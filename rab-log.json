now available from the IoSR Matlab Toolbox as iosr.dsp.ltas. \n------------------------- \nS = LTAS(X,FS) calculates the long-term average spectrum (LTAS) of signal X, sampled at FS Hz. The spectrum is calculated from the average power spectral density (PSD) obtained from a series of overlapping FFTs; the FFT length is 4096, and the hop size is 2048. The segments of X are Hann-windowed. The average PSD is then Gaussian-smoothed to 1/3-octave resolution. \nX can be a vector, matrix, or multidimensional array; LTAS will operate along the first non-signleton dimension, and return the LTAS for each corresponding row/column/etc. \n   \nS = LTAS(X,FS,'PARAMETER','VALUE') allows numerous parameters to be specified. These parameters are:- \n      'dim' : {find(size(X)\u0026gt;1,1,'first')} | scalar \n          Specifies the dimension of operation (defaults to the first non-singleton dimension). \n      'graph' : {false} | true \n          Choose whether to plot a graph of the LTAS. \n      'hop' : {NFFT/2} | scalar \n          Specifies the step size through X used to calculate each segment. NFFT is determined by the 'win' parameter. \n      'noct' : {3} | scalar \n          Apply 1/noct-octave smoothing to the frequency spectrum. Setting 'noct' to 0 results in no smoothing. \n      'scaling' : {'none'} | 'max0' \n          Specifies any scaling to apply to S. By default, no scaling is applied. If scaling is set to 'max0', S will be scaled to have a maximum value of 0. \n      'units' : {dB} | 'none' \n          Specifies the output units. By default the PSD is calculated in dB. Otherwise the PSD is returned directly. \n      'win' : {4096} | scalar | vector \n          Specifies the window or FFT length NFFT used to calculate the spectrum.
